Merge sort begins by treating the input array as a collection of single-element groups.
It then repeatedly merges these groups to produce larger sorted groups.
This merging process works by looking at the first item of each group and taking the smaller of the two.
After taking the smaller item, it will move to the next item in that group.
Once either group has been completely scanned, the remaining items from the other group are appeneded to the result.
After all groups are merged, the result is a single sorted array.
